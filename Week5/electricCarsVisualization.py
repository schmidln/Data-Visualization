**What does "2050 (Ideal)" mean?**  
This scenario assumes that **100% of all new vehicle sales are electric by 2035**.  
Given average vehicle lifespans and turnover rates, this results in **96% of all vehicles on the road being electric by 2050**â€”a near-complete transition away from internal combustion engines.

These projections help illustrate the scale and speed of electrification needed to meet long-term climate targets.
